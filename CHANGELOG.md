# Changelog

All notable changes to BT4 are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once it cuts
its first tagged release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Exact codon-trellis DP solver** (`bt4.optimize`) over the true per-constraint
  context, with an explicit `beam` speed knob and a machine-readable
  `OptimalityCertificate` (`proven_optimal` / `beam_truncated`).
- **Objective terms** (`bt4.objectives`): `CaiTerm` (log relative-adaptiveness)
  and `GcProximityTerm`, both additive with `delta == score` property tests.
- **Constraints** (`bt4.constraints`): `HomopolymerConstraint` and
  `ForbiddenMotifConstraint` (with automatic reverse complements), with
  `ok_suffix ⇔ validate` agreement property tests.
- **Pipeline + stable API** (`bt4.pipeline`, `bt4.api`): `optimize()`,
  `frontier()` (a CAI/GC Pareto frontier), and `validate()`, with metrics
  recomputed from the delivered DNA and a content-hashed provenance manifest.
- **`ObjectiveTerm` / `Constraint` protocols** and the `Scope` enum in the pure
  `domain` layer (the shared vocabulary the optimizer speaks).
- **`bt4` CLI**: `optimize`, `validate`, `organisms`, and `--version`.
- **BT4 Studio** (`bt4.app`): a native PySide6 desktop app calling `bt4.api` on a
  background thread — constraint controls, an honest optimality-certificate
  badge, a recomputed-metrics table, an interactive CAI/GC frontier plot, a
  sequence viewer, and FASTA/JSON export. Offline; nothing leaves the machine.
- **IO** (`bt4.io`): FASTA and versioned, deterministic JSON export.
- **Packaging & distribution**: a `packaging` extra, a PyInstaller spec
  (`packaging/bt4-studio.spec`) that builds a standalone BT4 Studio bundle, and a
  `Release` workflow that publishes the sdist + wheel and per-OS app bundles on a
  version tag.
- **Community health**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  and GitHub issue / pull-request templates; a landing-page `README.md` with a
  screenshot of BT4 Studio.

### Fixed
- **Wheel/sdist builds** were broken by a `pyproject.toml` `force-include` that
  double-added the codon data files (`pip install .` failed with "a second file
  is being added to the wheel archive at the same path"); replaced with
  `artifacts` so the data and `py.typed` marker ship exactly once.
- **Two import-linter layering violations** (`optimize → constraints`,
  `objectives → biomodels`) that surfaced once `bt4.app` existed — resolved by
  lifting the protocols into `domain` and decoupling `CaiTerm` from the codon
  table, keeping every pure layer importing only `domain`.

### Notes
- Richer objectives (tAI, codon-pair, 5′ ramp), ILP / relaxation backends, and
  the validated splice / folding / expression models are on the roadmap and are
  **not** yet shipped — see [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) §9.
